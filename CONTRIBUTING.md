## Pull Requests

**Please follow our commit message conventions** even if you're making a small change! This repository follows the
[conventional-changelog](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog/) standard and uses [this](https://github.com/rebelliard/rb-conventional-changelog) [commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) adapter to write consistent commit messages.

Please do the following:

* Follow the existing styles (we have an `.editorconfig` file and we are using [![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com/)).
* Add tests if needed.
* Document your changes in the README (try to follow the convention you see in the rest of the file).
* Use the command `npm run c` when ready to commit your changes. This will help you to provide proper commit messages that will be taken into account while generating the changelog.
